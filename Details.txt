Approach:
1.My approach towards this problem was simple I first imputed all the NAN values in 
columns with less than 30% NAN values.
2.Secondly i converted all the categorical columns into dummy data to use them for 
prediction and dropped the columns not useful.
3.Then i tried fitting a few models and found RandomForestRegressor as the best fit


Feature Engineering:
1. Model used RandomForestRegressor
2. Performance measure - mean squared log error
3. The following columns were used for prediction
